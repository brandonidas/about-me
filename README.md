> **My days in the medical corps were meaningful because *the mission was meaningful***. I want to leverage my skills and experiences to contribute to high impact projects, especially in areas that intersect with healthcare, education and technology. 

Hello :smile: I'm Brandon Tong. My journey in tech has been driven by a deep engagement in autodidactism. I've been coding since high school in 2014 when I made a full stack web app using M.E.A.N.js (mongodb, express.js, angular.js, node)! That's almost **10 years coding to date.** I love learning, and even during military service, I used my free time to finish Andrew Ng's Intro To Machine Learning.

| I specialized in AI/ML and distributed systems. I've researched high dimensional probability, maximum innner product search for vector databases, and optimisng LLM inference | I've interned at as a software engineer at reputable tech companies such as **Splunk**, where I contributed to launching their edge compute enginer, and ZALORA, where I work on integrating recommendation services into their API gateway.|

:military_helmet: **Military service** in the Singaporean army medical corps instilled in me a sense of mission. That day-to-day intentionality continues to drive my interest in applying technology to impactful endeavours, which is reflected in my academic pursuits in computational biology and graduate-level courses in Advanced Machine Learning and NLP.

:man_dancing: As a **TA and president** of _two_ high-activity university clubs, I've honed my leadership, communication, and teamwork skills.

Education: University of British Columbia, BSc. Computer Science, 4.0 GPA with a focus on ML and systems. Used elective credits to pursue graduate coursework in **advanced machine learning, natural language processing, distributed systems, probabilistic and randomised algorithms (which are fascinating!), applied high dimensional probability in computational biology, LLM inference.**
