# Brandon Tong

Hello! I'm Brandon Tong, a recent graduate from the University of British Columbia with a degree in Computer Science. My journey in tech has been driven by a passion for autodidactism and a deep interest in the potential of machine learning systems and high performance backend engineering.

During my academic career, I specialized in AI/ML and distributed systems, and gained hands-on in various projects and internships. I've interned at reputable tech companies such as Splunk, where I contributed to launching their edge compute enginer, and ZALORA, where I work on integrating recommendation services into their API gateway.

My military service in the Singaporean army medical corps instilled in me a profound sense of mission and a commitment to serving a purpose greater. This intentionality drives my interest in applying technology to impactful endeavours, which is reflected in my academic pursuits in bioinformatics and graduate-level courses in Advanced Machine Learning and NLP.

As a Computer Science TA and president of two high-activity university clubs, I've honed my leadership, communication, and teamwork skills. These experiences have taught me the importance of clear, empathetic communication and the value of a collaborative approach to problem-solving.

I want to leverage my skills and experiences to contribute to innovative projects, especially in areas that intersect with healthcare, education and technology. My days in the medical corps were meaningful because the mission was meaningful.

# Highlights
University of British Columbia, BSc. Computer Science, 4.0 GPA with a focus on ML and systems. **Used elective credits to pursue graduate coursework in advanced machine learning, natural language processing, distributed systems, probabilistic and randomised algorithms (which are fascinating!), applied high dimensional probability in computational biology, LLM inference.
**

I've been coding since high school in 2014 when I made a full stack web app using M.E.A.N.js (mongodb, express.js, angular.js, node)! That's almost **10 years coding to date.** I love learning, and even during military service, I used my free to finish Andrew Ng's Intro To Machine Learning.
