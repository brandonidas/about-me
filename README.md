# Brandon Tong

Hello! I'm Brandon Tong, a recent graduate from the University of British Columbia with a degree in Computer Science. My journey in tech has been driven by a passion for problem-solving and a deep interest in the potential of machine learning systems and high performance backend engineering.

During my academic career, I specialized in AI/ML and distributed systems, and gained hands-on experience with Python, Flask, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Docker in various projects and internships. I've interned at reputable tech companies such as Splunk, where I contributed to launching their edge compute enginer, and ZALORA, where I work on integrating recommendation services into their API gateway.

My military service in the Singaporean army medical corps instilled in me a profound sense of mission and a commitment to serving a purpose greater. This intentionality drives my interest in applying technology to impactful endeavour, which is reflected in my academic pursuits in bioinformatics and graduate-level courses in Advanced Machine Learning and NLP.

As a Computer Science TA and president of two high-activity university clubs, I've honed my leadership, communication, and teamwork skills. These experiences have taught me the importance of clear, empathetic communication and the value of a collaborative approach to problem-solving.

I want to leverage my skills and experiences to contribute to innovative projects, especially in areas that intersect with healthcare, education and technology.
