>** My days in the medical corps were meaningful because _the mission was meaningful._ ** I want to leverage my skills and experiences to contribute to high impact projects, especially in areas that intersect with healthcare, education and technology. 

Hello! I'm Brandon Tong. My journey in tech has been driven by a deep engagement in autodidactism. I've been coding since high school in 2014 when I made a full stack web app using M.E.A.N.js (mongodb, express.js, angular.js, node)! That's almost **10 years coding to date.** I love learning, and even during military service, I used my free to finish Andrew Ng's Intro To Machine Learning.

During university, I specialized in AI/ML and distributed systems, and gained hands-on in various projects and internships. I've interned at reputable tech companies such as Splunk, where I contributed to launching their edge compute enginer, and ZALORA, where I work on integrating recommendation services into their API gateway.

Military service in the Singaporean army medical corps instilled in me a sense of mission. That day-to-day intentionality continues to drive my interest in applying technology to impactful endeavours, which is reflected in my academic pursuits in bioinformatics and graduate-level courses in Advanced Machine Learning and NLP.

As a TA and the president of two high-activity university clubs, I've honed my leadership, communication, and teamwork skills. These experiences have taught me the importance of clear, empathetic communication and the value of a collaborative approach to problem-solving.
